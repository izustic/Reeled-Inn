## Problem Description:

Create A basic Express application, that makes a CRUD operation (create, read, update, delete) using SQLite database, document and publish your endpoints using postman.

  - `POST` Request which adds data to your database
  - `PUT` Request which updates fields of a particular data using the id in database
  - `DELETE` Request which removes a particular data from your database using the id
- Host your application on Heroku.
